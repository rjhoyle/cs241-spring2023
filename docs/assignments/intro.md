# CSCI 241 - Homework 0

*Due by 11:59.59pm Friday, February 03 or ASAP for late enrollees*

## Part 1

Read through the <a href="../index.html">course syllabus</a>.  We should have
gone over most of this in class, but I want you to be sure that
you've all seen it.  Make a note of any questions about this that you have and
submit them with part 2 or bring them up in class or at office hours.


Now that you have read the syllabus, you are responsible for the contents
therein.  This is where assignments will be posted and readings made.  I'm not
a big fan of <a href="http://blackboard.oberlin.edu/">BlackBoard</a>,
but I'll try to keep your grades posted there.  Let me know ASAP if either
service becomes unavailable.


### Piazza

For discussions, we will be using <a href="https://piazza.com/">Piazza</a>.  The signup link is in Blackboard.

We will use Slack exclusively for communication, both during class and other times.  You should also use it for communication with your groups when working on your project, but I will not be enforcing that.  During class times, Zoom chat is not preserved.  If you have questions, please post them on Slack and I will be monitoring it during the discussion.


Post an introduction to yourself in the *#introductions* channel.  Include who you are, why you are taking the class, a picture of yourself, and something interesting that makes you different from other people.

### Github
We will also be using <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> for some of the
assignments.  Please <a href="https://github.com/signup/free">create an
account</a> on this site using your @oberlin.edu email if you haven't
already done so.  Please name the account something that will lead me back to you, it is really frustrating to tie a funny name to a person.  You will also, hopefully, use the account in the future to share some of your code with prospective employers.  A funny name now may not be funny in 3 years...  If you have a prior account, you do not need to create a new one.  If you are creating one, please use some permutation of your name.



## Part 2

For this part, I want you to fill out the following form: <a href="https://forms.gle/y7j8EAB6yMNwy6PT9">https://forms.gle/y7j8EAB6yMNwy6PT9</a>

Then, send me an email to my <tt>@oberlin.edu</tt> account.  Be sure to include <b>cs241</b> (or <b>csci241</b>) in the subject. This will make it stand out in my email, and should help prevent it from being considered spam. Include the following:

* Your full name and what you prefer to be called in class (nickname and/or personal pronouns).  Give hints as to the pronunciation if needed.
* Also, include a picture of yourself that I can use to make a photo roster to help me match faces with names. So something recent, with your face visible, probably cropping out the background (you'd be surprised what I've been sent in the past).  If you don't have one, I'd be happy to take one of you.  You can even put it up on BlackBoard and then all your instructors can benefit.
* Briefly tell me about your CS background
	* Why you are taking this class and what you hope to get out of it.
	* One thing you are most anxious/worried about in this class.
	* Tell me about any background you have in CS classes, C/C++ programming,
* Tell me a little about yourself:
	* Tell me what you are majoring in or thinking of majoring in.
  * Tell me if you are part of a performance group, sports team, etc. While I can't always attend, feel free to invite me to events as I like to support my students.
  * Tell me something interesting about yourself that you would like to
	share with me.
* Include the requisite statement of the <a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/studentpolicies/honorcode/">Honor Code</a>:
<q class="honor">I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.</q>

That's it!  See you in class!
