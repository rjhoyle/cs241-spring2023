You might also be interested in the following books as personal references:

- C in a Nutshell 2nd Edition
- C: A reference manual, by Harbison and Steele

I have copies of these in my office and am happy to loan them out for a few hours.

## Mask Policy
The Oberlin Computer Science Department is dedicated to making Computer Science accessible to all students.  Because of this, we will be requiring that all students wear masks in our classrooms and lab spaces this semester.  By masking, you are not only demonstrating respect and kindness for your classmates, but also making sure that medically at-risk students have a learning experience where they can feel comfortable and safe.  Masking will be required for classes, lab periods, drop-in lab helping, and anytime you are using the CS labs or offices.  If you have forgotten to bring a mask with you, an instructor can provide you with one.  


## Course Description

From the [Oberlin catalog course description](https://www.oberlin.edu/catalog/college/compsci.html)
<blockquote>
<q>This course will consider the C programming language and its relationship to the Unix operating system. Students will be introduced to various Unix tools and shell scripting. Some Unix system programming issues will also be included. The course will require a significant amount of programming.</q>
